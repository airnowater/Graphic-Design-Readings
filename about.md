<h3>About the site</h3>
<p>For as long as I've been a designer, I've been a reader. My earliest design education came from the blogs, books, and magazines I discovered as a high school student, before I ever took a design class. These readings shaped my own understanding and interests in design. Years later, I now teach design at multiple institutions at both the undergraduate and graduate level and have find myself assigning many of the same readings, while recommending classic texts over and over again. I wanted to create an archive available for my students to find all of these texts while hopefully finding new voices. It is my hope this site provides a resource both for my students and the profession at large but housing many of these great design writers.</p>

<h3>A Note on the Archives</h3>
<p>While the goal of this site is to provide a collection of canonical and important texts on graphic design and related fields, I am well aware of its blindspots and gaps. The selections included here skew to my personal interests in design and my own education and preferences. When possible, essays link out to their original source and PDFs hosted here are freely assessible elsewhere on the web. To the best of my knowledge, I am not publishing anything new or copyrighted.</p>
